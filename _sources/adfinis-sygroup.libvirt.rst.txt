Default values
==============

   
action taken on host boot
- start   all guests which were running on shutdown are started on boot
          regardless on their autostart settings
- ignore  libvirt-guests init script won't start any guest on boot, however,
          guests marked as autostart will still be automatically started by
          libvirtd

.. code-block:: YAML

   libvirt_on_boot_action: start
   
Number of seconds to wait between each guest start. Set to 0 to allow
parallel startup.

.. code-block:: YAML

   libvirt_on_boot_delay: 2
   
action taken on host shutdown
- suspend   all running guests are suspended using virsh managedsave
- shutdown  all running guests are asked to shutdown. Please be careful with
            this settings since there is no way to distinguish between a
            guest which is stuck or ignores shutdown requests and a guest
            which just needs a long time to shutdown. When setting
            ON_SHUTDOWN=shutdown, you must also set SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT to a
            value suitable for your guests.

.. code-block:: YAML

   libvirt_on_shutdown_action: shutdown
   
Number of guests will be shutdown concurrently, taking effect when
"ON_SHUTDOWN" is set to "shutdown". If Set to 0, guests will be shutdown one
after another. Number of guests on shutdown at any time will not exceed number
set in this variable.

.. code-block:: YAML

   libvirt_on_shutdown_parallel: 2
   
Number of seconds we're willing to wait for a guest to shut down. If parallel
shutdown is enabled, this timeout applies as a timeout for shutting down all
guests on a single URI defined in the variable URIS. If this is 0, then there
is no time out (use with caution, as guests might not respond to a shutdown
request). The default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

.. code-block:: YAML

   libvirt_on_shutdown_timeout: 300
   
Allow managing LVM logical volumes with libvirt (for VM storage)?
Will result in the installation of additional packages on some systems.

.. code-block:: YAML

   libvirt_use_lvm_storage: false
