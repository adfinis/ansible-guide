YAML Syntax
===========

There is a basic guide at `ansible docs
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html>`_.
We use an indention of 2 spaces, no tabs.

Tasks
-----
::

  ---

  - name: Task 1
    module:
      arg1: Foo
      arg2: Bar
      arg3: '{{ item }}'
    with_items: '{{ role_data }}'

- Each file starts with ``---`` and a empty line after that.
- Each task has a empty line above the task
- Tasks have a name which contains only letters, numbers
  and spaces.  Task names start with an uppercase letter.
- Each argument of a module is on its own line
- Key and value are separated by colon and space.
- Values don't need to be quoted if they are single words
- Variables are always quoted and have a leading and a trailing space around the name
- Quoting with single quotes or double quotes is allowed, there is no
  preference.


Handler Tasks
-------------
::

  ---

  - name: Role handler task 1
    module:
      arg1: Foo
      arg2: '{{ role_service }}'

- Handlers follow the same rules as tasks.
- Each handler name must start with the role name.


Variables
---------
::

  ---

  # role_var1 description
  role_var1: 'Foo Bar'

- Variable names contains only lower case letters, numbers and underscores
- Each name starts with a role-name and an underline
- Values are quoted if they contain variables or spaces
- Quoting with single quotes or double quotes is allowed, there is no
  preference.
- Each variable has a description above.


Registered variables
--------------------
::

  ---

  - name: Task 1
    module:
      arg1: Foo
      arg2: Bar
    register: role_register_baz

- Registered variables contains only lower letters, numbers and underlines
- The name starts with the role-name and ``_register_`` concatenated (except
  special cases, where the registered variable should overwrite default
  variables).


vim Config
==========

For syntax highlighting there is a vim plugin on GitHub
`pearofducks/ansible-vim <https://github.com/pearofducks/ansible-vim>`_.
This plugin will also make a better indention feeling in vim with yaml.
